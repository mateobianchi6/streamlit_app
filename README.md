## Mateo's App Information
My app asks the user to upload a CSV file into the file upload button at the top of the page, and then analyzes it.
After uploading the file, users should select one of it's columns.
They can then toggle to different tabs to look at categorical or numerical variable analysis, according to the type of the column that they chose.
